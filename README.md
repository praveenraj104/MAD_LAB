# Mobile Application Development Course Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for the Mobile Application Development course, which includes various exercises and projects focused on Android app development. It covers fundamental concepts of Android, database handling, UI design, and implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques in mobile apps.

## List of Experiments

### 1. Introduction to Android Development
- **Overview**: About Android, prerequisites for learning Android, Dalvik Virtual Machine, .apk file extension, and Android API levels (versions & version names).
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Android Java basics
  - Project folder structure
  - Simple programming and running an Android project
  - Generating build/APK from Android Studio

### 2. Font and Color Change Application
- **Objective**: Develop an application to change the font and color of the text and display a toast message when the user presses a button.

### 3. Scientific Calculator
- **Objective**: Develop a scientific calculator to perform arithmetic and mathematical functions using the `Math` class.
- **Functions**: Addition, multiplication, division, cos, sin, tan, power, square root, log, natural log, mod.

### 4. SQLite Database Operations
- **Objective**: Create a database table with the following structure: `Student (Name, Roll No, Marks)`. Implement Android operations to:
  - Insert student details
  - Update the student record
